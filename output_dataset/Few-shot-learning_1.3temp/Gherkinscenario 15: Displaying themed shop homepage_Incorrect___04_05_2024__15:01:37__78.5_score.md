### Context
We are translating Gherkin acceptance criteria into Rimay CNL.
For this translation use the following information:

$ACTOR is for example a thing or a person.
$MODAL_VERB is for  the following word: should or can
$TRIGGER is for example a trigger action, nothing what a system does.

$WHILE_STRUCTUREis the word  'When' followed by the Gherkin When condition
$WHEN_STRUCTURE  is the word 'While' followed by the Gherkin Given condition 
$SYSTEM_RESPONSE is a combination of the Actors and the Gherkin Then condition.

$ACTOR, $MODAL_VERB and a $SYSTEM_RESPONSE is mandatory in all Rimay requirements.
Replace the variables with the right text according the input acceptance criteria.
In the following order: 

Rimay CNL definition: $SYSTEM_RESPONSE $MODAL_VERB $WHILE_STRUCTURE $ACTOR $WHEN_STRUCTURE

With the usage of the following extra information:
Actors: actor SystemA, actor SystemB, actor SystemC, actor UserX, actor UserA, actor UserC
