## Gherkin Input
```
Given: the exchange rate of "US Dollar" to "British Pound" is 1.30
When: UserA wants to edit this exchange rate
Then: UserA should see that the source currency is disabled
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Chain of Thought


Learn from the following example, the output information for the CNL Rimay is: 
This part is the start of the example you have to learn from:

The input information is as follows: 

Acceptance Criteria 1 in Gherkin, input:
Gherkin:
Scenario: Create an Order
Given an Order of type Subscription_Order does not exist in OI of type Order_Issuer 
When OI Create Order, 
Then Order exists in OI 
And the property settlement_method of Order is equal to FOP


Rimay output 1:
When the Order_Issuer (OI ) executes Create a Subscription_Order, if the Order does not exist, then the Order is created and its settlement_method is set to FOP.

Rimay uses the following structure:
When the? Actor <Action> (every "Frequency")? ,|then the? Actor must <Action> (every "Text")?.

Ending for example

Translate the following input acceptance criteria Gherkin, according to the example above, to Rimay:

        

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: the exchange rate of "US Dollar" to "British Pound" is 1.30
When: UserA wants to edit this exchange rate
Then: UserA should see that the source currency is disabled
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only your translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
Given the exchange rate of "US Dollar" to "British Pound" is 1.30, when UserA wants to edit this exchange rate, then UserA must see that the source currency is disabled.
