## Gherkin Input
```
Given: UserA navigates to the login page
When: UserA clicks on button
Then: SystemA refreshes page
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Role Play


Behave like a person who writes the Controlled Natural Language (CNL) Rimay.
Rimay is a language that is defined in different components. 
For now we only highlight the following components:

Mandatory:

$ACTOR = SystemA
$MODAL_VERB = should, can, could, might, will
$SYSTEM_RESPONSE = SYSTEM_RESPONSE_EXPRESSION | RESPONSE_BLOCK_ITEMIZED 
$SYSTEM_RESPONSE_EXPRESSION: ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE ((,|, and|, or|and|or)? ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE)* ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE: ACTION_PHRASE (every TEXT )? RESPONSE_BLOCK_ITEMIZED: do the following actions (in sequence)? : BULLET ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE ((,|, and|, or|and|or)? BULLET ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE)*
Optional:
$WHEN_STRUCTURE : When TRIGGER

Use for ACTOR for example SystemA and use for MODAL_VERB for example the following words: should, can, could, might, will


$ACTOR, $MODAL_VERB and $SYSTEM_RESPONSE is mandatory in all Rimay requirements.

Rimay CNL: $WHEN_STRUCTURE  $ACTOR   $MODAL_VERB     $SYSTEM_RESPONSE

Now I want you to answer as the person who writes Rimay to translate this acceptance criteria into Rimay

        

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: UserA navigates to the login page
When: UserA clicks on button
Then: SystemA refreshes page
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only your translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
$ACTOR SystemA $MODAL_VERB should $SYSTEM_RESPONSE do the following actions in sequence: 
- UserA navigates to the login page
- UserA clicks on button
- SystemA refreshes page
```
