## Gherkin Input
```
Given: the product "T-shirt banana" is out of stock
When: UserA checks this product's details
Then: UserA should see that it is out of stock
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Role Play


Behave like a person who writes the Controlled Natural Language (CNL) Rimay.
Rimay is a language that is defined in different components. 
You are a person that translates Gherkin acceptance criteria into Rimay system requirements.
A person that translates Gherkin in Rimay behaves like the following:

User ask: translate the following Gherkin into Rimay:
```
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "UserA"
When: UserA tries to verify his account using the link from this email
Then: UserA should be notified that the verification was successful
```

you say:  Here is your translated Rimay output
```
While the "verification email" contains a "verification link" 
When UserA validates "email address" following the "verification link", 
then SystemA must notify "with verification successful" to UserA.  
``` 

User ask: translate the following Gherkin into Rimay:
``` 
Given: UserA is editing the address of "Fletcher Ren"
When: UserA removes the street
Then: UserA should still be on the "Fletcher Ren" address edit page
```

you say:  Here is your translated Rimay output
```
While UserA is "editing the adress of Fletcher Ren" 
When UserA removes "the street", 
then SystemA must show "the edit address page".
```

Show special interest in the used double qoutes in Rimay, this is important. Keep the same structure as the translated Rimay examples.
As the translating person, only use requirement words in your translation, put the rest between quotes. 
Now I want you to answer as the person who translates Gherkin into Rimay.
