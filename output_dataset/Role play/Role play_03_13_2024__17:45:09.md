## Gherkin Input
Given: UserA navigates to the login page
When: UserA clicks on button
Then: SystemA refreshes page

    



## Input prompt, technique: Role Play


        Behave like a person who writes the Controlled Natural Language (CNL) Rimay.
        Rimay is a language that is defined in different components. 
        For now we only highlight the following components:

        Mandatory:

        $ACTOR = SystemA
        $MODAL_VERB = should, can, could, might, will
        $SYSTEM_RESPONSE = SYSTEM_RESPONSE_EXPRESSION | RESPONSE_BLOCK_ITEMIZED 
        $SYSTEM_RESPONSE_EXPRESSION: ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE ((,|, and|, or|and|or)? ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE)* ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE: ACTION_PHRASE (every TEXT )? RESPONSE_BLOCK_ITEMIZED: do the following actions (in sequence)? : BULLET ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE ((,|, and|, or|and|or)? BULLET ATOMIC_SYSTEM_RESPONSE)*
        Optional:
        $WHEN_STRUCTURE : When TRIGGER

        Use for ACTOR for example SystemA and use for MODAL_VERB for example the following words: should, can, could, might, will


        $ACTOR, $MODAL_VERB and $SYSTEM_RESPONSE is mandatory in all Rimay requirements.

        Rimay CNL: $WHEN_STRUCTURE  $ACTOR   $MODAL_VERB     $SYSTEM_RESPONSE

        Now I want you to answer as the person who writes Rimay to translate this acceptance criteria into Rimay

        

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input data: 
Given: UserA navigates to the login page
When: UserA clicks on button
Then: SystemA refreshes page

### Question:
Can you translate the inputdata above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only your translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
$ACTOR SystemA $MODAL_VERB should $SYSTEM_RESPONSE SystemA refreshes page 
            


## Rimay DSL Verification
('', "ERROR:missing EOF at '$' (line : 3 column : 1)\n")

            


## Rimay Paska Verification
