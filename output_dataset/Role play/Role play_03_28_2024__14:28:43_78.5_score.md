## Gherkin Input
```
Given: the exchange rate of "US Dollar" to "British Pound" is 1.30
When: UserA wants to edit this exchange rate
Then: UserA should see that the source currency is disabled
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Role Play


Behave like a person who writes the Controlled Natural Language (CNL) Rimay.
Rimay is a language that is defined in different components. 
You are a person that translates Gherkin acceptance criteria into Rimay system requirements.
A person that translates Gherkin in Rimay behaves like the following:

Gherkin (input):
```
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "UserA"
When: UserA tries to verify his account using the link from this email
Then: UserA should be notified that the verification was successful
```

Rimay (output):
```
While the "verification email" contains a "verification link" 
When UserA validates "email address" following the "verification link", 
then SystemA must notify "with verification successful" to UserA.  
``` 

Another example is:

Gherkin (input):
``` 
Given: UserA is editing the address of "Fletcher Ren"
When: UserA removes the street
Then: UserA should still be on the "Fletcher Ren" address edit page
```

Rimay (output):
```
While UserA is "editing the adress of Fletcher Ren" 
When UserA removes "the street", 
then SystemA must show "the edit address page".
```

Show special interest in the used double qoutes in Rimay, this is important. Keep the same structure as the translated Rimay examples.

Now I want you to answer as the person who translates Gherkin into Rimay.

        

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: the exchange rate of "US Dollar" to "British Pound" is 1.30
When: UserA wants to edit this exchange rate
Then: UserA should see that the source currency is disabled
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only your translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
While the "exchange rate" of "US Dollar" to "British Pound" is 1.30 
When UserA wants to "edit this exchange rate", 
then SystemA must display "the source currency disabled" to UserA.
```
