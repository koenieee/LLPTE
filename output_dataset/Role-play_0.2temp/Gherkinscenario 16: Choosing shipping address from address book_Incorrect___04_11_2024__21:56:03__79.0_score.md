## Gherkin Input
```
Given: UserA has product "PHP T-Shirt" in the cart
When: UserA chooses "Seaside Fwy" street for shipping address
Then: address "Lucifer Morningstar, Seaside Fwy, 90802, Los Angeles, United States, Arkansas" should be filled as shipping address
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Role-Play


Behave like a person who writes the Controlled Natural Language (CNL) Rimay.
Rimay is a language that is defined in different components. 
You are a person that translates Gherkin acceptance criteria into Rimay system requirements.
A person that translates Gherkin in Rimay behaves like the following:

One person (person A) speaks Gherkin, the acceptance criteria language.
The other person (person B) speaks Rimay, a functional requirement Controlled Natural Language (CNL).

The conversation goes as follows

1. When person A says:
```
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "operator"
```

1. You say (person B):
```
 the "verification email" contains a "verification link" 
```

2. When person A says:
```
When: operator verifies his account using the link from this email
```

2. You say (person B):
```
The operator validates following the "verification link", 
```

3. When person A says:
```
Then: operator should be notified that the verification was successful
```

3. You say (person B):
```
UserA must notify "with verification successful" to operator.  
```


So person B pays special attention to the common structure of Rimay. 
Output the total rimay output as follows:

1.
2.
3.

Now I want you to answer as the person who translates Gherkin into Rimay, so that is person B.
Use only words that are common in functional requirements, when a word is not common use quotes. 
Do not output empty rimay structures!
        

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: UserA has product "PHP T-Shirt" in the cart
When: UserA chooses "Seaside Fwy" street for shipping address
Then: address "Lucifer Morningstar, Seaside Fwy, 90802, Los Angeles, United States, Arkansas" should be filled as shipping address
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only the translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
1. The "UserA" has "PHP T-Shirt" in the cart
2. UserA selects "Seaside Fwy" street for shipping address
3. The shipping address should be completed with "Lucifer Morningstar, Seaside Fwy, 90802, Los Angeles, United States, Arkansas"
```
