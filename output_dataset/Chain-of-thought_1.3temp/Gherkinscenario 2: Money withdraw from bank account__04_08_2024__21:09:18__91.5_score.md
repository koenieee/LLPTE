## Gherkin Input
```
Given: UserA bank account is in credit
When: UserA attempts to withdraw an amount less than UserA card's limit
Then: the withdrawal should be complete without errors or warnings
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Chain-of-Thought


Learn from the following example, the output information for the CNL Rimay is: 
This part is the start of the example you have to learn from:

The input information is as follows: 

Gherkin input 1:
Scenario: Create an Order
Given an Order of type Subscription_Order does not exist in OI of type Order_Issuer 
When OI Create Order, 
Then Order exists in OI 
And the property settlement_method of Order is equal to FOP


Rimay output 1:
While the Order does not exist, 
When the Order_Issuer (OI ) executes Create a Subscription_Order, 
then the Order is created and its settlement_method is set to FOP.


Gherkin input 2:
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "operator"
When: operator verifies his account using the link from this email
Then: operator should be notified that the verification was successful

Rimay output 2:
While the "verification email" contains a "verification link" 
When operator validates "email address" following the "verification link", 
then system must notify "with verification successful" to operator.  
 

Gherkin input 3: 
Given: visitor is edits the address of "Fletcher Ren"
When: visitor deletes the street
Then: visitor should still be on the "Fletcher Ren" address edit page


Rimay output 3:
While visitor is "edits the adress of Fletcher Ren" 
When visitor removes "the street", 
then website must show "the edit address page".

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: UserA bank account is in credit
When: UserA attempts to withdraw an amount less than UserA card's limit
Then: the withdrawal should be complete without errors or warnings
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only the translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
While UserA bank account is in credit,\
When UserA tries to withdraw an amount lower than UserA card's limit,\
then the withdrawal should be successful without any errors or warnings.
```
