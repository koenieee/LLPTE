## Gherkin Input
```
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "UserA"
When: UserA tries to verify his account using the link from this email
Then: UserA should be notified that the verification was successful
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Chain-of-Thought


Learn from the following example, the output information for the CNL Rimay is: 
This part is the start of the example you have to learn from:

The input information is as follows: 

Gherkin input 1:
Scenario: Create an Order
Given an Order of type Subscription_Order does not exist in OI of type Order_Issuer 
When OI Create Order, 
Then Order exists in OI 
And the property settlement_method of Order is equal to FOP


Rimay output 1:
While the Order does not exist, 
When the Order_Issuer (OI ) executes Create a Subscription_Order, 
then the Order is created and its settlement_method is set to FOP.


Gherkin input 2:
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "operator"
When: operator verifies his account using the link from this email
Then: operator should be notified that the verification was successful

Rimay output 2:
While the "verification email" contains a "verification link" 
When operator validates "email address" following the "verification link", 
then system must notify "with verification successful" to operator.  
 

Gherkin input 3: 
Given: visitor is edits the address of "Fletcher Ren"
When: visitor deletes the street
Then: visitor should still be on the "Fletcher Ren" address edit page


Rimay output 3:
While visitor is "edits the adress of Fletcher Ren" 
When visitor removes "the street", 
then website must show "the edit address page".

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "UserA"
When: UserA tries to verify his account using the link from this email
Then: UserA should be notified that the verification was successful
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only the translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
While the "verification email" has been sent to "UserA"
When UserA attempts to verify his account using the link from this email
then UserA should be notified that the verification was successful.
```
