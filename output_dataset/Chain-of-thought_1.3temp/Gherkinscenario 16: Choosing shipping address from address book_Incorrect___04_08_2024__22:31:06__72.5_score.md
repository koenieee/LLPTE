## Gherkin Input
```
Given: UserA has product "PHP T-Shirt" in the cart
When: UserA chooses "Seaside Fwy" street for shipping address
Then: address "Lucifer Morningstar, Seaside Fwy, 90802, Los Angeles, United States, Arkansas" should be filled as shipping address
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Chain-of-Thought


Learn from the following example, the output information for the CNL Rimay is: 
This part is the start of the example you have to learn from:

The input information is as follows: 

Gherkin input 1:
Scenario: Create an Order
Given an Order of type Subscription_Order does not exist in OI of type Order_Issuer 
When OI Create Order, 
Then Order exists in OI 
And the property settlement_method of Order is equal to FOP


Rimay output 1:
When the Order_Issuer (OI ) executes  a Subscription_Order, 
then the  is set to FOP.


Gherkin input 2:
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "operator"
When: operator tries to verify his account using the link from this email
Then: operator should be notified that the verification was successful

Rimay output 2:
When operator validates "email address" 
then system must notify operator.  
 

Gherkin input 3: 
visitor is editing the address of "Fletcher Ren"
Then: visitor should still be on the "Fletcher Ren" address edit page


Rimay output 3:
While visitor is "Ren" 
then website must show something.


Ending example of translation from Gherkin into Rimay.
