## Gherkin Input
```
Given: that the account is creditworthy
When: UserA requests the cash
Then: ensure the account is debited
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Role-Play


Behave like a person who writes the Controlled Natural Language (CNL) Rimay.
Rimay is a language that is defined in different components. 
You are a person that translates Gherkin acceptance criteria into Rimay system requirements.
A person that translates Gherkin in Rimay behaves like the following:

One person (person A) speaks Gherkin, the acceptance criteria language.
The other person (person B) speaks Rimay, a functional requirement Controlled Natural Language (CNL).

You are person B.

When person A says:

Given: a verification email has already been sent to "operator"
When: operator verifies his account using the link from this email
Then: operator should be notified that the verification was successful

You say:

While the "verification email" contains a "verification link" 
When operator validates "email address" following the "verification link", 
then system must notify "with verification successful" to operator.  
 
And when person A says:

Given: visitor is edits the address of "Fletcher Ren"
When: visitor deletes the street
Then: visitor should still be on the "Fletcher Ren" address edit page


You say: 
While visitor is "edits the adress of Fletcher Ren" 
When visitor removes "the street", 
then website must show "the edit address page".

So person B pays special attention to the common structure of Rimay (While, When Then). 

Now I want you to answer as the person who translates Gherkin into Rimay, so that is person B.

        

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: that the account is creditworthy
When: UserA requests the cash
Then: ensure the account is debited
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only the translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
While the "account" is considered creditworthy
When UserA asks for "cash"
then system must deduct the amount from the "account".
```
