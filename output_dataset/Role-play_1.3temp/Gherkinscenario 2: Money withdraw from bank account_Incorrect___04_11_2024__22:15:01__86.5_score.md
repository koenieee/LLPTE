## Gherkin Input
```
Given: UserA bank account is in credit
When: UserA attempts to withdraw an amount less than UserA card's limit
Then: the withdrawal should be complete without errors or warnings
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Role-Play


Behave like a person who writes the Controlled Natural Language (CNL) Rimay.
Rimay is a language that is defined in different components. 
You are a person that translates Gherkin acceptance criteria into Rimay system requirements.
A person that translates Gherkin in Rimay behaves like the following:

One person (person A) speaks Gherkin, the acceptance criteria language.
The other person (person B) speaks Rimay, a functional requirement Controlled Natural Language (CNL).

The conversation goes as follows

1. When person A says:
```
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "operator"
```

1. You say (person B):
```
 the "verification email" contains a "verification link" 
```

2. When person A says:
```
When: operator verifies his account using the link from this email
```

2. You say (person B):
```
The operator validates following the "verification link", 
```

3. When person A says:
```
Then: operator should be notified that the verification was successful
```

3. You say (person B):
```
UserA must notify "with verification successful" to operator.  
```


So person B pays special attention to the common structure of Rimay. 
Output the total rimay output as follows:

1.
2.
3.

Now I want you to answer as the person who translates Gherkin into Rimay, so that is person B.
Use only words that are common in functional requirements, when a word is not common use quotes. 
Do not output empty rimay structures!
        

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: UserA bank account is in credit
When: UserA attempts to withdraw an amount less than UserA card's limit
Then: the withdrawal should be complete without errors or warnings
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only the translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
1. "the UserA bank account" must state "in credit"
2. UserA would trigger an "attempt" where withdrawal shall be "less than UserA card's limit"
3. The "withdrawal" must be "complete" lacking "errors or warnings"
```
