## Gherkin Input
```
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "UserA"
When: UserA tries to verify his account using the link from this email
Then: UserA should be notified that the verification was successful
```
    



## Input prompt, technique: Few-Shot Learning


### Context
We are translating Gherkin acceptance criteria into Rimay CNL.
For this translation use the followin information:

$ACTOR is for example a thing or a person.
$MODAL_VERB is for  the following word: must or shall.
$TRIGGER is for example a trigger action, something what a system does.

$WHILE_STRUCTURE is the word 'While' followed by the Gherkin Given condition
$WHEN_STRUCTURE is the word  'When' followed by the Gherkin When condition
$SYSTEM_RESPONSE is a combination of the Actors and the Gherkin Then condition.

$ACTOR, $MODAL_VERB and a $SYSTEM_RESPONSE is mandatory in all Rimay requirements.
Replace the variables with the right text according the input acceptance criteria.
In the following order: 

Rimay CNL definition: $WHILE_STRUCTURE $WHEN_STRUCTURE   $ACTOR   $MODAL_VERB    $SYSTEM_RESPONSE

The following example is a valid Rimay CNL:

When SystemB receives an "email alert" from SystemA, SystemB must send an Instruction to SystemC.

With the usage of the following extra information:
Actors: actor SystemA, actor SystemB, actor SystemC, actor UserX, actor UserA, actor UserC

THIS IS NOT VALID RIMAY:
When UserA navigates to the login page, UserA clicks on button, SystemA must refresh the page.

The following example would be valid:
When UserA "navigates to the login page", UserA "clicks on button", SystemA must "refresh the page".
        

### Input Data
Use the following Gherkin acceptance criteria input: 
```
Given: a verification email has already been sent to "UserA"
When: UserA tries to verify his account using the link from this email
Then: UserA should be notified that the verification was successful
```

### Question:
Can you translate the input above into the specified language Rimay CNL?

### Output indicator
Output only your translated Rimay CNL text and nothing else!


## Rimay Output
```
While UserA "tries to verify his account using the link from this email" When UserA must be notified that the verification was successful.
```
