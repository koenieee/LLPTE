# Dataset Gherkin

The dataset in `input_dataset.xml` is custom made and derrived from the `Open_Source_Projects_GitHub_US_AC_Analysis.xlsx` file

There is an original tag and an simplified tag in the dataset xml file

The simplified tag is used to make it easer for the LLM to translate Gherkin into Rimay. I made some adjustments to the sentence.
